## load crime data
crimedata <- read.csv(file = "##put path to file here", header = TRUE, sep=",")

## clean up the data so that the only 2 columns are "complaint date" and "borough name"
crimedata <- crimedata[c("CMPLNT_FR_DT", "BORO_NM")]
## clean up data for the rows that only contain Manhattan 
crimedata_manhattan <- crimedata[crimedata$BORO_NM %in% c("MANHATTAN"), ]
## export the dataframe to csv
##write.csv(crimedata_manhattan, file = "")

## Used pivot table in Excel in order to process the data further
## Added up the number of crimes per day for Manhattan since Januaray 01, 2006 until December 31st, 2016
## Noticed that there were Date values that were incomplete/incorrect 
## Excel made it very easy to delete those values 
## Made the data into a time-series-dataframe-compatible format by fixing the Dates to 
##    "(last digit of year)-(Month abbreviation)" format.
##     for example: January, 2006 => 6-Jan
## After aggregating the number of crimes per day in Manhattan, we noticed that there wasn't much data from 2011 to 2014.
## We deleted the data that we had for those years to allow for more accurate time series analysis - (we used data only from 2006 to 2010)
